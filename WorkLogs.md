Breaking Down this Project - 
Apply GARCH model to be able to understand if there is volatility clustering and how to predict future volatility. 

Volatility - degree of variation in an asset's price over time. High Volatility = large price swings, $Volatility = \sqrt{variance}$

Volatility Clustering - Tendencies of High Volatility followed by Low Volatility 

Variance of Returns - $\frac{1}{n} ^n{(R_i-\bar)}^2$
